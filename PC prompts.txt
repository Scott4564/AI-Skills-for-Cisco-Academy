You are a digital circuits instructor creating a quiz for high school students on signal filter types. You need to create a question bank, answer key, and explanation that students can check. Write 5 similar questions on capacitor and inductor low pass, high pass, band pass filters with a one sentence explanation using impedance:

1.
Given that a signal is sent across a capacitor in series to a resistor. If a load is parallel to the resistor how will the input signal be affected?
a. the output signal will be amplified
b. the output signal will only have low frequencies
c. the output signal will only have high frequencies
d. the output signal will only have frequencies in the middle
Answer: c
Explanation: At high frequencies, the capacitor's impedance becomes very low, allowing high-frequency signals to pass through to the resistor and load.

2.
A resistor is in series with an inductor, and a load is connected across the inductor. How will the signal be affected?
a. the output signal will only have low frequencies
b. the output signal will only have high frequencies
c. the output signal will be amplified
d. the output signal will be blocked
Answer: a
Explanation: At low frequencies, the inductorâ€™s impedance is low, so low-frequency signals appear across the inductor and reach the load.

3.
A capacitor is in series with a resistor, and the output is taken across the resistor. What kind of filter is this and what frequencies pass through?
a. Band-pass; mid frequencies
b. High-pass; high frequencies
c. Low-pass; low frequencies
d. High-pass; low frequencies
Answer: b
Explanation: The capacitor blocks low frequencies due to high impedance at low frequency, so only high frequencies reach the resistor.

4.
An inductor is in series with a resistor, and the output is taken across the resistor. What type of filter does this form?
a. Low-pass filter
b. High-pass filter
c. Band-stop filter
d. Amplifier
Answer: a
Explanation: The inductor's impedance increases with frequency, so it blocks high frequencies and allows low ones to pass to the resistor.

5.
A signal passes through a capacitor, then an inductor, and the output is taken between them. How will the input signal be affected?
a. only low frequencies pass
b. only high frequencies pass
c. only middle frequencies pass
d. all frequencies are blocked
Answer: c
Explanation: A capacitor blocks low frequencies and an inductor blocks high frequencies, so only mid-range frequencies pass, forming a band-pass filter.
